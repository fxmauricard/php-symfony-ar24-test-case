# AR24 Test Case

## About
A simple mockup that demonstrates AR24 integration in a modern PHP/Symfony application context.

- Created using the Symfony Docker template (https://github.com/dunglas/symfony-docker). 
- Added Symfony CLI in Dockerfile for local development convenience (https://symfony.com/download).
- Started with Symfony 8.0 skeleton (https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html).

## Getting Started

1. If not already done, [install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (v2.10+).
2. Run `docker compose build --pull --no-cache` to build fresh images.
3. Run `docker compose up --wait` to set up and start the application.
4. Open `https://localhost` in your favorite web browser and [accept the auto-generated TLS certificate](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15076602/1352334).
5. Run `docker compose down --remove-orphans` to stop the Docker containers.
